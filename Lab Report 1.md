#### 1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
##### cd:
Absolute path: /workspaces/lecture1
This did not produce an error because ‘cd’ means to change the directory. Since there is no argument, it changed the directory to /home/codespace

##### ls:
Absolute path: /home/codespace
‘Ls’ did not produce an error because ‘ls’ just produces a list of the contents of the given path since there is no argument, it just list out the contents of the absolute path

##### cat: 
Absolute path: /home/codespace
I believe this produced an error because ‘cat’ means print the contents of one or more files given by the paths. Without an argument, there is nothing to produce.

#### 2. Share an example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
##### cd:
Absolute path: /workspaces/lecture1
This does not produce an error because it changed the directory to ‘~’ which is the argument which is /home/codespace

![Image](cd2.png)
##### ls:
Absolute path: /home/codespace
This does not produce an error because it list out the content of the directory
![Image](ls2.png)
##### cat:
Absolute path: /home/codespace
This did not result in an error however it did not print out the contents within this argument

#### 3. Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.
##### cd:
Absolute Path:/home/codespace
This did not produce an error because it changed the directory to ~/lecture1’
![Image](cd3.png)
##### ls:
Absolute path: /home/codespace/lecture1
This resulted in an error because in the directory ‘/home/codespace/lecture1’ there is no file called lecture1

![Image](ls3.png)
##### cat:
Absolute path: /home/codespace/lecture1
This resulted in an error because in the directory ‘/home/codespace/lecture1’ there is no lecture1 and therefore cannot list out the contents that is within ‘lecture1’
