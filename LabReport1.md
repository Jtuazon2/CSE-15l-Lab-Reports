During lecture and the lab, I have learned many simple filesystem commands such as pwd, which allows us to see the current working directory, cd, which allows us to change the current directory and ls, which lists out the contents of a directory. In this lab, we had to use and show what each commands did.



#### 1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
##### cd:
Absolute path: /workspaces/lecture1

This output was produced because changing the cd with no arguments just changes it to /home

This did not produce an error because ‘cd’ means to change the directory. Since there is no argument, it changed the directory to /home/codespace

##### ls:
Absolute path: /home/codespace

This output was produced because 'ls' lists the contents of what is inside of the working directory.

‘Ls’ did not produce an error because ‘ls’ just produces a list of the contents of the given path since there is no argument, it just list out the contents of the absolute path

##### cat: 
Absolute path: /home/codespace

This was the output because cat needs an argument of a file name in order to print out the contents of a certtain file.

I believe this produced an error because ‘cat’ means print the contents of one or more files given by the paths. Without an argument, there is nothing to produce.

#### 2. Share an example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
##### cd:
Absolute path: /workspaces/lecture1



This does not produce an error because it changed the directory to ‘~’ which is the argument which is /home/codespace

##### ls:
Absolute path: /home/codespace
This does not produce an error because it list out the content of the directory

![Image](ls2.png)
##### cat:
Absolute path: /home/codespace
This did not result in an error however it did not print out the contents within this argument

#### 3. Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.
##### cd:
Absolute Path:/home/codespace
This did not produce an error because it changed the directory to ~/lecture1’

![Image](cd3.png)
##### ls:
Absolute path: /home/codespace/lecture1
This resulted in an error because in the directory ‘/home/codespace/lecture1’ there is no file called lecture1

![Image](ls3.png)
##### cat:
Absolute path: /home/codespace/lecture1
This resulted in an error because in the directory ‘/home/codespace/lecture1’ there is no lecture1 and therefore cannot list out the contents that is within ‘lecture1’
