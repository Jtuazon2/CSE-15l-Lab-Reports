## Part 1 - Bugs
1. A failure inducing bug as a junit test and any accociated code
   - A failure inducing bug as a JUnit test is when testing the reversed method because when inputing a non-empty array it causes a failure in a test case

3. An input that doesn't induce a failure as a JUnit test and any associated code
   - An input that does not induce a failure asa JUnit test is using the array `{2.0, ,4.0, 6.0, 8.0}` for the average without lowest because it does not cause a failure in the test case 

5. The sympton, as the output of running the two tests above (provide a screenshot -- one test should pass and the other should fail)
   

7. The bug, as the before-and-after code change required tp fix it (as two code blocks in markdown)

8. Briefly describe (2-3 sentences) why the fix addresses the issue


## part 2 - Researching Commands

choose either less, find, and grep and find 4 interesting command line options or alternate ways to use the single command you choose. For each of those options give 2 examples of using it on files and directories from ./technical. show example as a code block. 

CITE your sources via a url or description on where you found it.
